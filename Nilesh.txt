DASHBOARD CALCULATIONS
===================

Hello @Nilesh sir

You can refer to this :

upcoming invoice generation = invoice date + buffer day = current date.
Not created invoice = invoice date + buffer day < current date.
Invoice delayed = Project milestones which are marked as delayed for project/cr.
Payment due = invoice created date + payment term days = current date.
Payment overdue = invoice created date + payment term days < current date.
